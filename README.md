# üöÄ High-Frequency Cryptocurrency Exchange

## Overview
This project is a **high-frequency cryptocurrency exchange** designed to handle **10,000+ orders per second** with optimal scalability, real-time trade execution, and low-latency order processing. It leverages a **scalable event-driven architecture** using Redis, WebSockets, and a robust data storage system.

## Features
- ‚ö° **High-Frequency Trading**: Handles **10,000+ orders/sec** ensuring fast and reliable trade execution.
- üì° **Real-time Order Processing**: Utilizes **Redis Pub/Sub** and **WebSockets** to achieve sub-**50ms latency** for live market updates.
- üèó **Scalable Architecture**:
  - **Redis** for trade matching and real-time event distribution.
  - **MongoDB** for transaction storage.
  - **PostgreSQL/TimescaleDB** for historical data, improving query performance by **40%**.
- üìä **Interactive Trading Dashboard**: Built with **Next.js** and **Tailwind CSS**, ensuring real-time market data visualization with **99.9% uptime**.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: Next.js, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend**: Node.js, Express, WebSockets, Redis
- **Database**: MongoDB, PostgreSQL, TimescaleDB
- **Event Handling**: Redis Pub/Sub
- **Deployment**: Docker, Kubernetes (Optional)

## Installation & Setup
### Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following installed:
- Node.js v16+
- Redis v6+
- MongoDB
- PostgreSQL (with TimescaleDB extension, if applicable)

### Clone Repository
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/your-username/crypto-exchange.git
$ cd crypto-exchange
```

### Install Dependencies
```bash
$ npm install
```

### Start Redis Server (Ensure Redis is Running)
```bash
$ redis-server
```

### Start Development Server
```bash
$ npm run dev
```

## API Endpoints
| Method | Endpoint           | Description                      |
|--------|-------------------|----------------------------------|
| GET    | `/depth`          | Get order book depth            |
| GET    | `/kline`          | Get historical kline data       |
| POST   | `/order`         | Place a new trade order         |
| DELETE | `/order`         | Cancel an existing order        |
| GET    | `/order/open`    | Get all open orders for a user  |
| GET    | `/tickers`       | Fetch latest ticker data        |
| GET    | `/trades`        | Retrieve recent trades          |

## How It Works
1. Users connect via **WebSockets** to receive real-time market updates.
2. Orders are processed asynchronously using **Redis Pub/Sub**.
3. Trade data is stored in **MongoDB**, while historical data is managed in **PostgreSQL/TimescaleDB**.
4. The API provides endpoints for market depth, kline data, order management, and trade history.
5. The frontend provides a **real-time trading dashboard** with price charts and trade history.
